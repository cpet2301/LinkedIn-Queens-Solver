# LinkedIn-Queens-Solver
This project is a LinkedIn queens solver implemented in Python. The LinkedIn Queens game adds a new twist to the classic N-Queens problem by introducing additional rules. In this version of the puzzle, the chessboard is divided into several colored regions, and the goal is to place $N$ queens on the board in such a way that:  

* Each row contains exactly one queen.  
* Each column contains exactly one queen.  
* Each colored region contains exactly one queen.
* No queens are adjacent vertically, horizontally, or diagonally to each other.

The solver is designed to efficiently find solutions using well-known algorithms such as backtracking, while being highly modular and easy to extend. Whether you're solving for 8 queens or scaling up to larger chessboards, this project offers a robust solution that can be customized and optimized.

## Key Features:

* Solve any LinkedIn Queens puzzle in real-time
* Toggle between various search algorithms and compare their performances
* Learn with understandable, clean code that follows best practices and provide intuition through comments
* Extend the modular framework with new optimizations or strategies
